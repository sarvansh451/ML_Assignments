# Simple Linear Regression with Gradient Descent

## Overview
- Implements a Simple Linear Regression model using Gradient Descent.
- Tasks include training on a dataset, exploring learning rates, and comparing optimization methods.

## Features
- Batch Gradient Descent implementation.
- Learning rate comparison (0.005, 0.5, 5).
- Cost function vs iteration plots.
- Stochastic and mini-batch gradient descent.
- Visualizations of regression results.

## Requirements
- numpy
- matplotlib
- pandas

## How to Run
- Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:
